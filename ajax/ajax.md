AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
AJAX just uses a combination of:
-A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server) JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

Ajax is to handle request responses without reloading the web page.
There is no class or method of Ajax. 
It is actually the XMLHttpRequest() used in the code.
# Later on, javascript introduced # Fetch API to handle request response 
# Now we can use Axios,
